AppConfig supports controlled deployments to applications of any size and includes built-in validation checks and monitoring. You can use AppConfig with applications hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, AWS Lambda, containers, mobile applications, or IoT devices. To prevent errors when deploying application configurations, especially for production systems where a simple typo could cause an unexpected outage, AppConfig includes validators. A validator provides a syntactic or semantic check to ensure that the configuration you want to deploy works as intended. To validate your application configuration data, you provide a schema or a Lambda function that runs against the configuration. The configuration deployment or update can only proceed when the configuration data is valid. During a configuration deployment, AppConfig monitors the application to ensure that the deployment is successful. If the system encounters an error, AppConfig rolls back the change to minimize impact for your application users. You can configure a deployment strategy for each application or environment that includes deployment criteria, including velocity, bake time, and alarms to monitor. Similar to error monitoring, if a deployment triggers an alarm, AppConfig automatically rolls back to the previous version.  AppConfig supports multiple use cases. Here are some examples.    Application tuning: Use AppConfig to carefully introduce changes to your application that can only be tested with production traffic.    Feature toggle: Use AppConfig to turn on new features that require a timely deployment, such as a product launch or announcement.

You can use CodeArtifact to share packages with development teams and pull packages. Packages can be pulled from both public and CodeArtifact repositories. You can also create an upstream relationship between a CodeArtifact repository and another repository, which effectively merges their contents from the point of view of a package manager client.   AWS CodeArtifact Components  Use the information in this guide to help you work with the following CodeArtifact components:    Repository: A CodeArtifact repository contains a set of package versions, each of which maps to a set of assets, or files. Repositories are polyglot, so a single repository can contain packages of any supported type. Each repository exposes endpoints for fetching and publishing packages using tools like the  npm  CLI, the Maven CLI ( mvn ), and  pip .    Domain: Repositories are aggregated into a higher-level entity known as a domain. All package assets and metadata are stored in the domain, but are consumed through repositories. A given package asset, such as a Maven JAR file, is stored once per domain, no matter how many repositories it's present in. All of the assets and metadata in a domain are encrypted with the same customer master key (CMK) stored in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). Each repository is a member of a single domain and can't be moved to a different domain. The domain allows organizational policy to be applied across multiple repositories, such as which accounts can access repositories in the domain, and which public repositories can be used as sources of packages. Although an organization can have multiple domains, we recommend a single production domain that contains all published artifacts so that teams can find and share packages across their organization.    Package: A package is a bundle of software and the metadata required to resolve dependencies and install the software. CodeArtifact supports npm, PyPI, and Maven package formats. In CodeArtifact, a package consists of:   A name (for example, webpack is the name of a popular npm package)   An optional namespace (for example, @types in @types/node)   A set of versions (for example, 1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2, etc.)    Package-level metadata (for example, npm tags)      Package version: A version of a package, such as @types/node 12.6.9. The version number format and semantics vary for different package formats. For example, npm package versions must conform to the Semantic Versioning specification. In CodeArtifact, a package version consists of the version identifier, metadata at the package version level, and a set of assets.    Upstream repository: One repository is upstream of another when the package versions in it can be accessed from the repository endpoint of the downstream repository, effectively merging the contents of the two repositories from the point of view of a client. CodeArtifact allows creating an upstream relationship between two repositories.    Asset: An individual file stored in CodeArtifact associated with a package version, such as an npm .tgz file or Maven POM and JAR files.   CodeArtifact supports these operations:    AssociateExternalConnection: Adds an existing external connection to a repository.     CopyPackageVersions: Copies package versions from one repository to another repository in the same domain.    CreateDomain: Creates a domain    CreateRepository: Creates a CodeArtifact repository in a domain.     DeleteDomain: Deletes a domain. You cannot delete a domain that contains repositories.     DeleteDomainPermissionsPolicy: Deletes the resource policy that is set on a domain.    DeletePackageVersions: Deletes versions of a package. After a package has been deleted, it can be republished, but its assets and metadata cannot be restored because they have been permanently removed from storage.    DeleteRepository: Deletes a repository.     DeleteRepositoryPermissionsPolicy: Deletes the resource policy that is set on a repository.    DescribeDomain: Returns a DomainDescription object that contains information about the requested domain.    DescribePackageVersion: Returns a PackageVersionDescription object that contains details about a package version.     DescribeRepository: Returns a RepositoryDescription object that contains detailed information about the requested repository.     DisposePackageVersions: Disposes versions of a package. A package version with the status Disposed cannot be restored because they have been permanently removed from storage.    DisassociateExternalConnection: Removes an existing external connection from a repository.     GetAuthorizationToken: Generates a temporary authorization token for accessing repositories in the domain. The token expires the authorization period has passed. The default authorization period is 12 hours and can be customized to any length with a maximum of 12 hours.    GetDomainPermissionsPolicy: Returns the policy of a resource that is attached to the specified domain.     GetPackageVersionAsset: Returns the contents of an asset that is in a package version.     GetPackageVersionReadme: Gets the readme file or descriptive text for a package version.    GetRepositoryEndpoint: Returns the endpoint of a repository for a specific package format. A repository has one endpoint for each package format:     npm     pypi     maven       GetRepositoryPermissionsPolicy: Returns the resource policy that is set on a repository.

For more information about the structure of stages and actions, see AWS CodePipeline Pipeline Structure Reference. Pipeline stages include actions that are categorized into categories such as source or build actions performed in a stage of a pipeline. For example, you can use a source action to import artifacts into a pipeline from a source such as Amazon S3. Like stages, you do not work with actions directly in most cases, but you do define and interact with actions when working with pipeline operations such as CreatePipeline and GetPipelineState. Valid action categories are:   Source   Build   Test   Deploy   Approval   Invoke   Pipelines also include transitions, which allow the transition of artifacts from one stage to the next in a pipeline after the actions in one stage complete. You can work with transitions by calling:    DisableStageTransition, which prevents artifacts from transitioning to the next stage in a pipeline.    EnableStageTransition, which enables transition of artifacts between stages in a pipeline.     Using the API to integrate with AWS CodePipeline  For third-party integrators or developers who want to create their own integrations with AWS CodePipeline, the expected sequence varies from the standard API user. To integrate with AWS CodePipeline, developers need to work with the following items:  Jobs, which are instances of an action. For example, a job for a source action might import a revision of an artifact from a source.  You can work with jobs by calling:    AcknowledgeJob, which confirms whether a job worker has received the specified job.    GetJobDetails, which returns the details of a job.    PollForJobs, which determines whether there are any jobs to act on.    PutJobFailureResult, which provides details of a job failure.     PutJobSuccessResult, which provides details of a job success.    Third party jobs, which are instances of an action created by a partner action and integrated into AWS CodePipeline. Partner actions are created by members of the AWS Partner Network. You can work with third party jobs by calling:    AcknowledgeThirdPartyJob, which confirms whether a job worker has received the specified job.

You can use the connections API to work with connections and installations.  Connections are configurations that you use to connect AWS resources to external code repositories. Each connection is a resource that can be given to services such as CodePipeline to connect to a third-party repository such as Bitbucket. For example, you can add the connection in CodePipeline so that it triggers your pipeline when a code change is made to your third-party code repository. Each connection is named and associated with a unique ARN that is used to reference the connection. When you create a connection, the console initiates a third-party connection handshake. Installations are the apps that are used to conduct this handshake. For example, the installation for the Bitbucket provider type is the Bitbucket app. When you create a connection, you can choose an existing installation or create one. When you want to create a connection to an installed provider type such as GitHub Enterprise Server, you create a host for your connections. You can work with connections by calling:    CreateConnection, which creates a uniquely named connection that can be referenced by services such as CodePipeline.

It automatically identifies servers, virtual machines (VMs), and network dependencies in your on-premises data centers. For more information, see the AWS Application Discovery Service FAQ. Application Discovery Service offers three ways of performing discovery and collecting data about your on-premises servers:    Agentless discovery is recommended for environments that use VMware vCenter Server. This mode doesn't require you to install an agent on each host. It does not work in non-VMware environments.   Agentless discovery gathers server information regardless of the operating systems, which minimizes the time required for initial on-premises infrastructure assessment.   Agentless discovery doesn't collect information about network dependencies, only agent-based discovery collects that information.        Agent-based discovery collects a richer set of data than agentless discovery by using the AWS Application Discovery Agent, which you install on one or more hosts in your data center.    The agent captures infrastructure and application information, including an inventory of running processes, system performance information, resource utilization, and network dependencies.   The information collected by agents is secured at rest and in transit to the Application Discovery Service database in the cloud.         AWS Partner Network (APN) solutions integrate with Application Discovery Service, enabling you to import details of your on-premises environment directly into Migration Hub without using the discovery connector or discovery agent.   Third-party application discovery tools can query AWS Application Discovery Service, and they can write to the Application Discovery Service database using the public API.   In this way, you can import data into Migration Hub and view it, so that you can associate applications with servers and track migrations.      Recommendations  We recommend that you use agent-based discovery for non-VMware environments, and whenever you want to collect information about network dependencies. You can run agent-based and agentless discovery simultaneously. Use agentless discovery to complete the initial infrastructure assessment quickly, and then install agents on select hosts to collect additional information.  Working With This Guide  This API reference provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each of the actions and data types for Application Discovery Service. The topic for each action shows the API request parameters and the response. Alternatively, you can use one of the AWS SDKs to access an API that is tailored to the programming language or platform that you're using. For more information, see AWS SDKs.

You must make API calls for write actions (create, notify, associate, disassociate, import, or put) while in your home region, or a HomeRegionNotSetException error is returned.   API calls for read actions (list, describe, stop, and delete) are permitted outside of your home region.   Although it is unlikely, the Migration Hub home region could change. If you call APIs outside the home region, an InvalidInputException is returned.   You must call GetHomeRegion to obtain the latest Migration Hub home region.

This guide is for developers who need detailed information about AWS Global Accelerator API actions, data types, and errors. For more information about Global Accelerator features, see the AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide. AWS Global Accelerator is a service in which you create accelerators to improve the performance of your applications for local and global users. Depending on the type of accelerator you choose, you can gain additional benefits.    By using a standard accelerator, you can improve availability of your internet applications that are used by a global audience. With a standard accelerator, Global Accelerator directs traffic to optimal endpoints over the AWS global network.    For other scenarios, you might choose a custom routing accelerator. With a custom routing accelerator, you can use application logic to directly map one or more users to a specific endpoint among many endpoints.    Global Accelerator is a global service that supports endpoints in multiple AWS Regions but you must specify the US West (Oregon) Region to create or update accelerators.  By default, Global Accelerator provides you with two static IP addresses that you associate with your accelerator. With a standard accelerator, instead of using the IP addresses that Global Accelerator provides, you can configure these entry points to be IPv4 addresses from your own IP address ranges that you bring to Global Accelerator. The static IP addresses are anycast from the AWS edge network. For a standard accelerator, they distribute incoming application traffic across multiple endpoint resources in multiple AWS Regions, which increases the availability of your applications. Endpoints for standard accelerators can be Network Load Balancers, Application Load Balancers, Amazon EC2 instances, or Elastic IP addresses that are located in one AWS Region or multiple Regions. For custom routing accelerators, you map traffic that arrives to the static IP addresses to specific Amazon EC2 servers in endpoints that are virtual private cloud (VPC) subnets.  The static IP addresses remain assigned to your accelerator for as long as it exists, even if you disable the accelerator and it no longer accepts or routes traffic. However, when you delete an accelerator, you lose the static IP addresses that are assigned to it, so you can no longer route traffic by using them. You can use IAM policies like tag-based permissions with Global Accelerator to limit the users who have permissions to delete an accelerator. For more information, see Tag-based policies.  For standard accelerators, Global Accelerator uses the AWS global network to route traffic to the optimal regional endpoint based on health, client location, and policies that you configure. The service reacts instantly to changes in health or configuration to ensure that internet traffic from clients is always directed to healthy endpoints. For a list of the AWS Regions where Global Accelerator and other services are currently supported, see the AWS Region Table. AWS Global Accelerator includes the following components:  Static IP addresses  Global Accelerator provides you with a set of two static IP addresses that are anycast from the AWS edge network. If you bring your own IP address range to AWS (BYOIP) to use with a standard accelerator, you can instead assign IP addresses from your own pool to use with your accelerator. For more information, see  Bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP) in AWS Global Accelerator. The IP addresses serve as single fixed entry points for your clients. If you already have Elastic Load Balancing load balancers, Amazon EC2 instances, or Elastic IP address resources set up for your applications, you can easily add those to a standard accelerator in Global Accelerator. This allows Global Accelerator to use static IP addresses to access the resources. The static IP addresses remain assigned to your accelerator for as long as it exists, even if you disable the accelerator and it no longer accepts or routes traffic. However, when you delete an accelerator, you lose the static IP addresses that are assigned to it, so you can no longer route traffic by using them. You can use IAM policies like tag-based permissions with Global Accelerator to delete an accelerator. For more information, see Tag-based policies.  Accelerator  An accelerator directs traffic to endpoints over the AWS global network to improve the performance of your internet applications. Each accelerator includes one or more listeners. There are two types of accelerators:   A standard accelerator directs traffic to the optimal AWS endpoint based on several factors, including the user\\u2019s location, the health of the endpoint, and the endpoint weights that you configure. This improves the availability and performance of your applications. Endpoints can be Network Load Balancers, Application Load Balancers, Amazon EC2 instances, or Elastic IP addresses.   A custom routing accelerator directs traffic to one of possibly thousands of Amazon EC2 instances running in a single or multiple virtual private clouds (VPCs). With custom routing, listener ports are mapped to statically associate port ranges with VPC subnets, which allows Global Accelerator to determine an EC2 instance IP address at the time of connection. By default, all port mapping destinations in a VPC subnet can't receive traffic. You can choose to configure all destinations in the subnet to receive traffic, or to specify individual port mappings that can receive traffic.   For more information, see Types of accelerators.  DNS name  Global Accelerator assigns each accelerator a default Domain Name System (DNS) name, similar to a1234567890abcdef.awsglobalaccelerator.com, that points to the static IP addresses that Global Accelerator assigns to you or that you choose from your own IP address range. Depending on the use case, you can use your accelerator's static IP addresses or DNS name to route traffic to your accelerator, or set up DNS records to route traffic using your own custom domain name.  Network zone  A network zone services the static IP addresses for your accelerator from a unique IP subnet. Similar to an AWS Availability Zone, a network zone is an isolated unit with its own set of physical infrastructure. When you configure an accelerator, by default, Global Accelerator allocates two IPv4 addresses for it. If one IP address from a network zone becomes unavailable due to IP address blocking by certain client networks, or network disruptions, then client applications can retry on the healthy static IP address from the other isolated network zone.  Listener  A listener processes inbound connections from clients to Global Accelerator, based on the port (or port range) and protocol (or protocols) that you configure. A listener can be configured for TCP, UDP, or both TCP and UDP protocols. Each listener has one or more endpoint groups associated with it, and traffic is forwarded to endpoints in one of the groups. You associate endpoint groups with listeners by specifying the Regions that you want to distribute traffic to. With a standard accelerator, traffic is distributed to optimal endpoints within the endpoint groups associated with a listener.  Endpoint group  Each endpoint group is associated with a specific AWS Region. Endpoint groups include one or more endpoints in the Region. With a standard accelerator, you can increase or reduce the percentage of traffic that would be otherwise directed to an endpoint group by adjusting a setting called a traffic dial. The traffic dial lets you easily do performance testing or blue/green deployment testing, for example, for new releases across different AWS Regions.   Endpoint  An endpoint is a resource that Global Accelerator directs traffic to. Endpoints for standard accelerators can be Network Load Balancers, Application Load Balancers, Amazon EC2 instances, or Elastic IP addresses. An Application Load Balancer endpoint can be internet-facing or internal. Traffic for standard accelerators is routed to endpoints based on the health of the endpoint along with configuration options that you choose, such as endpoint weights. For each endpoint, you can configure weights, which are numbers that you can use to specify the proportion of traffic to route to each one. This can be useful, for example, to do performance testing within a Region. Endpoints for custom routing accelerators are virtual private cloud (VPC) subnets with one or many EC2 instances\",\n      loadSpec: \"aws/globalaccelerator\"\n    }, {\n      name: \"glue\",\n      description: \"AWS Glue Defines the public endpoint for the AWS Glue service\",\n      loadSpec: \"aws/glue\"\n    }, {\n      name: \"greengrass\",\n      description: \"AWS IoT Greengrass seamlessly extends AWS onto physical devices so they can act locally on the data they generate, while still using the cloud for management, analytics, and durable storage.

JSON is used for both requests and responses, including errors. The API is an AWS regional service, currently in these regions: us-west-2, us-east-1, and eu-west-1.   All API request parameters and URLs are case sensitive.    For a summary of notable documentation changes in each release, see  Document History.  Service Endpoints  The following are the Amazon IVS service endpoints (all HTTPS):  Region name: US West (Oregon)   Region: us-west-2    Endpoint: ivs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com    Region name: US East (Virginia)   Region: us-east-1    Endpoint: ivs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com    Region name: EU West (Dublin)   Region: eu-west-1    Endpoint: ivs.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com     Allowed Header Values      Accept:  application/json     Accept-Encoding:  gzip, deflate     Content-Type: application/json    Resources  The following resources contain information about your IVS live stream (see  Getting Started with Amazon IVS):   Channel \\u2014 Stores configuration data related to your live stream. You first create a channel and then use the channel\\u2019s stream key to start your live stream. See the Channel endpoints for more information.    Stream key \\u2014 An identifier assigned by Amazon IVS when you create a channel, which is then used to authorize streaming. See the StreamKey endpoints for more information.  Treat the stream key like a secret, since it allows anyone to stream to the channel.     Playback key pair \\u2014 Video playback may be restricted using playback-authorization tokens, which use public-key encryption. A playback key pair is the public-private pair of keys used to sign and validate the playback-authorization token. See the PlaybackKeyPair endpoints for more information.   Recording configuration \\u2014 Stores configuration related to recording a live stream and where to store the recorded content. Multiple channels can reference the same recording configuration. See the Recording Configuration endpoints for more information.    Tagging  A tag is a metadata label that you assign to an AWS resource. A tag comprises a key and a value, both set by you. For example, you might set a tag as topic:nature to label a particular video category. See Tagging AWS Resources for more information, including restrictions that apply to tags. Tags can help you identify and organize your AWS resources. For example, you can use the same tag for different resources to indicate that they are related. You can also use tags to manage access (see  Access Tags).  The Amazon IVS API has these tag-related endpoints: TagResource, UntagResource, and ListTagsForResource. The following resources support tagging: Channels, Stream Keys, Playback Key Pairs, and Recording Configurations.  Authentication versus Authorization  Note the differences between these concepts:    Authentication is about verifying identity. You need to be authenticated to sign Amazon IVS API requests.    Authorization is about granting permissions. You need to be authorized to view Amazon IVS private channels. (Private channels are channels that are enabled for \\\"playback authorization.\\\")    Authentication  All Amazon IVS API requests must be authenticated with a signature. The AWS Command-Line Interface (CLI) and Amazon IVS Player SDKs take care of signing the underlying API calls for you. However, if your application calls the Amazon IVS API directly, it\\u2019s your responsibility to sign the requests. You generate a signature using valid AWS credentials that have permission to perform the requested action. For example, you must sign PutMetadata requests with a signature generated from an IAM user account that has the ivs:PutMetadata permission. For more information:   Authentication and generating signatures \\u2014 See Authenticating Requests (AWS Signature Version 4) in the AWS General Reference.   Managing Amazon IVS permissions \\u2014 See Identity and Access Management on the Security page of the Amazon IVS User Guide.    Channel Endpoints     CreateChannel \\u2014 Creates a new channel and an associated stream key to start streaming.    GetChannel \\u2014 Gets the channel configuration for the specified channel ARN (Amazon Resource Name).    BatchGetChannel \\u2014 Performs GetChannel on multiple ARNs simultaneously.    ListChannels \\u2014 Gets summary information about all channels in your account, in the AWS region where the API request is processed. This list can be filtered to match a specified name or recording-configuration ARN. Filters are mutually exclusive and cannot be used together. If you try to use both filters, you will get an error (409 Conflict Exception).    UpdateChannel \\u2014 Updates a channel's configuration. This does not affect an ongoing stream of this channel. You must stop and restart the stream for the changes to take effect.    DeleteChannel \\u2014 Deletes the specified channel.    StreamKey Endpoints     CreateStreamKey \\u2014 Creates a stream key, used to initiate a stream, for the specified channel ARN.    GetStreamKey \\u2014 Gets stream key information for the specified ARN.    BatchGetStreamKey \\u2014 Performs GetStreamKey on multiple ARNs simultaneously.    ListStreamKeys \\u2014 Gets summary information about stream keys for the specified channel.    DeleteStreamKey \\u2014 Deletes the stream key for the specified ARN, so it can no longer be used to stream.    Stream Endpoints     GetStream \\u2014 Gets information about the active (live) stream on a specified channel.    ListStreams \\u2014 Gets summary information about live streams in your account, in the AWS region where the API request is processed.    StopStream \\u2014 Disconnects the incoming RTMPS stream for the specified channel. Can be used in conjunction with DeleteStreamKey to prevent further streaming to a channel.    PutMetadata \\u2014 Inserts metadata into the active stream of the specified channel. A maximum of 5 requests per second per channel is allowed, each with a maximum 1 KB payload. (If 5 TPS is not sufficient for your needs, we recommend batching your data into a single PutMetadata call.)    PlaybackKeyPair Endpoints  For more information, see Setting Up Private Channels in the Amazon IVS User Guide.    ImportPlaybackKeyPair \\u2014 Imports the public portion of a new key pair and returns its arn and fingerprint. The privateKey can then be used to generate viewer authorization tokens, to grant viewers access to private channels (channels enabled for playback authorization).    GetPlaybackKeyPair \\u2014 Gets a specified playback authorization key pair and returns the arn and fingerprint. The privateKey held by the caller can be used to generate viewer authorization tokens, to grant viewers access to private channels.    ListPlaybackKeyPairs \\u2014 Gets summary information about playback key pairs.    DeletePlaybackKeyPair \\u2014 Deletes a specified authorization key pair. This invalidates future viewer tokens generated using the key pair\\u2019s privateKey.    RecordingConfiguration Endpoints     CreateRecordingConfiguration \\u2014 Creates a new recording configuration, used to enable recording to Amazon S3.    GetRecordingConfiguration \\u2014 Gets the recording-configuration metadata for the specified ARN.

This guide describes the AWS KMS operations that you can call programmatically. For general information about AWS KMS, see the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide .  AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, macOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS KMS and other AWS services. For example, the SDKs take care of tasks such as signing requests (see below), managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see Tools for Amazon Web Services.  We recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls to AWS KMS. Clients must support TLS (Transport Layer Security) 1.0. We recommend TLS 1.2. Clients must also support cipher suites with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) such as Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE). Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes.  Signing Requests  Requests must be signed by using an access key ID and a secret access key. We strongly recommend that you do not use your AWS account (root) access key ID and secret key for everyday work with AWS KMS. Instead, use the access key ID and secret access key for an IAM user. You can also use the AWS Security Token Service to generate temporary security credentials that you can use to sign requests. All AWS KMS operations require Signature Version 4.  Logging API Requests  AWS KMS supports AWS CloudTrail, a service that logs AWS API calls and related events for your AWS account and delivers them to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. By using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were made to AWS KMS, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the AWS CloudTrail User Guide.

This guide is for developers who need detailed information about the Network Firewall API actions, data types, and errors.    The REST API requires you to handle connection details, such as calculating signatures, handling request retries, and error handling. For general information about using the AWS REST APIs, see AWS APIs.  To access Network Firewall using the REST API endpoint: https://network-firewall.<region>.amazonaws.com     Alternatively, you can use one of the AWS SDKs to access an API that's tailored to the programming language or platform that you're using. For more information, see AWS SDKs.   For descriptions of Network Firewall features, including and step-by-step instructions on how to use them through the Network Firewall console, see the Network Firewall Developer Guide.   Network Firewall is a stateful, managed, network firewall and intrusion detection and prevention service for Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC). With Network Firewall, you can filter traffic at the perimeter of your VPC. This includes filtering traffic going to and coming from an internet gateway, NAT gateway, or over VPN or AWS Direct Connect. Network Firewall uses rules that are compatible with Suricata, a free, open source intrusion detection system (IDS) engine. For information about Suricata, see the Suricata website. You can use Network Firewall to monitor and protect your VPC traffic in a number of ways. The following are just a few examples:    Allow domains or IP addresses for known AWS service endpoints, such as Amazon S3, and block all other forms of traffic.   Use custom lists of known bad domains to limit the types of domain names that your applications can access.   Perform deep packet inspection on traffic entering or leaving your VPC.   Use stateful protocol detection to filter protocols like HTTPS, regardless of the port used.   To enable Network Firewall for your VPCs, you perform steps in both Amazon VPC and in Network Firewall. For information about using Amazon VPC, see Amazon VPC User Guide. To start using Network Firewall, do the following:    (Optional) If you don't already have a VPC that you want to protect, create it in Amazon VPC.    In Amazon VPC, in each Availability Zone where you want to have a firewall endpoint, create a subnet for the sole use of Network Firewall.    In Network Firewall, create stateless and stateful rule groups, to define the components of the network traffic filtering behavior that you want your firewall to have.    In Network Firewall, create a firewall policy that uses your rule groups and specifies additional default traffic filtering behavior.    In Network Firewall, create a firewall and specify your new firewall policy and VPC subnets. Network Firewall creates a firewall endpoint in each subnet that you specify, with the behavior that's defined in the firewall policy.

You can use AWS OpsWorks CM to create and manage AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate and AWS OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise servers, and add or remove nodes for the servers to manage.  Glossary of terms     Server: A configuration management server that can be highly-available. The configuration management server runs on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance, and may use various other AWS services, such as Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) and Elastic Load Balancing. A server is a generic abstraction over the configuration manager that you want to use, much like Amazon RDS. In AWS OpsWorks CM, you do not start or stop servers. After you create servers, they continue to run until they are deleted.    Engine: The engine is the specific configuration manager that you want to use. Valid values in this release include ChefAutomate and Puppet.    Backup: This is an application-level backup of the data that the configuration manager stores. AWS OpsWorks CM creates an S3 bucket for backups when you launch the first server. A backup maintains a snapshot of a server's configuration-related attributes at the time the backup starts.    Events: Events are always related to a server. Events are written during server creation, when health checks run, when backups are created, when system maintenance is performed, etc. When you delete a server, the server's events are also deleted.    Account attributes: Every account has attributes that are assigned in the AWS OpsWorks CM database. These attributes store information about configuration limits (servers, backups, etc.) and your customer account.     Endpoints  AWS OpsWorks CM supports the following endpoints, all HTTPS.

For more information, see How DNS Resolvers on Your Network Forward DNS Queries to Route 53 Resolver in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.  Conditionally forward queries from a VPC to resolvers on your network  You can configure Resolver to forward queries that it receives from EC2 instances in your VPCs to DNS resolvers on your network. To forward selected queries, you create Resolver rules that specify the domain names for the DNS queries that you want to forward (such as example.com), and the IP addresses of the DNS resolvers on your network that you want to forward the queries to. If a query matches multiple rules (example.com, acme.example.com), Resolver chooses the rule with the most specific match (acme.example.com) and forwards the query to the IP addresses that you specified in that rule. For more information, see How Route 53 Resolver Forwards DNS Queries from Your VPCs to Your Network in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide. Like Amazon VPC, Resolver is regional. In each region where you have VPCs, you can choose whether to forward queries from your VPCs to your network (outbound queries), from your network to your VPCs (inbound queries), or both\",\n      loadSpec: \"aws/route53resolver\"\n    }, {\n      name: \"s3control\",\n      description: \"AWS S3 Control provides access to Amazon S3 control plane actions\",\n      loadSpec: \"aws/s3control\"\n    }, {\n      name: \"s3outposts\",\n      description: \"Amazon S3 on Outposts provides access to S3 on Outposts operations\",\n      loadSpec: \"aws/s3outposts\"\n    }, {\n      name: \"sagemaker\",\n      description: \"Provides APIs for creating and managing Amazon SageMaker resources.

API Version  This version of the Secrets Manager API Reference documents the Secrets Manager API version 2017-10-17.  As an alternative to using the API, you can use one of the AWS SDKs, which consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms such as Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, and Android. The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS Secrets Manager. For example, the SDKs provide cryptographically signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more information about the AWS SDKs, including downloading and installing them, see Tools for Amazon Web Services.  We recommend you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls to Secrets Manager. However, you also can use the Secrets Manager HTTP Query API to make direct calls to the Secrets Manager web service. To learn more about the Secrets Manager HTTP Query API, see Making Query Requests in the AWS Secrets Manager User Guide.  Secrets Manager API supports GET and POST requests for all actions, and doesn't require you to use GET for some actions and POST for others. However, GET requests are subject to the limitation size of a URL. Therefore, for operations that require larger sizes, use a POST request.  Support and Feedback for AWS Secrets Manager  We welcome your feedback. Send your comments to awssecretsmanager-feedback@amazon.com, or post your feedback and questions in the AWS Secrets Manager Discussion Forum. For more information about the AWS Discussion Forums, see Forums Help.  How examples are presented  The JSON that AWS Secrets Manager expects as your request parameters and the service returns as a response to HTTP query requests contain single, long strings without line breaks or white space formatting. The JSON shown in the examples displays the code formatted with both line breaks and white space to improve readability. When example input parameters can also cause long strings extending beyond the screen, you can insert line breaks to enhance readability. You should always submit the input as a single JSON text string.  Logging API Requests  AWS Secrets Manager supports AWS CloudTrail, a service that records AWS API calls for your AWS account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By using information that's collected by AWS CloudTrail, you can determine the requests successfully made to Secrets Manager, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. For more about AWS Secrets Manager and support for AWS CloudTrail, see Logging AWS Secrets Manager Events with AWS CloudTrail in the AWS Secrets Manager User Guide.

We recommend migrating your resources to this version, because it has a number of significant improvements. If you used AWS WAF prior to this release, you can't use this AWS WAFV2 API to access any AWS WAF resources that you created before. You can access your old rules, web ACLs, and other AWS WAF resources only through the AWS WAF Classic APIs. The AWS WAF Classic APIs have retained the prior names, endpoints, and namespaces.  For information, including how to migrate your AWS WAF resources to this version, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide.   AWS WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to Amazon CloudFront, an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an Application Load Balancer, or an AWS AppSync GraphQL API. AWS WAF also lets you control access to your content. Based on conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses that requests originate from or the values of query strings, the API Gateway REST API, CloudFront distribution, the Application Load Balancer, or the AWS AppSync GraphQL API responds to requests either with the requested content or with an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden). You also can configure CloudFront to return a custom error page when a request is blocked. This API guide is for developers who need detailed information about AWS WAF API actions, data types, and errors. For detailed information about AWS WAF features and an overview of how to use AWS WAF, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide. You can make calls using the endpoints listed in AWS Service Endpoints for AWS WAF.    For regional applications, you can use any of the endpoints in the list. A regional application can be an Application Load Balancer (ALB), an API Gateway REST API, or an AppSync GraphQL API.    For AWS CloudFront applications, you must use the API endpoint listed for US East (N. Virginia): us-east-1.   Alternatively, you can use one of the AWS SDKs to access an API that's tailored to the programming language or platform that you're using. For more information, see AWS SDKs. We currently provide two versions of the AWS WAF API: this API and the prior versions, the classic AWS WAF APIs. This new API provides the same functionality as the older versions, with the following major improvements:   You use one API for both global and regional applications. Where you need to distinguish the scope, you specify a Scope parameter and set it to CLOUDFRONT or REGIONAL.    You can define a Web ACL or rule group with a single call, and update it with a single call. You define all rule specifications in JSON format, and pass them to your rule group or Web ACL calls.

There\\nare two types of path arguments: ``LocalPath`` and ``S3Uri``.\\n\\n``LocalPath``: represents the path of a local file or directory.  It can be\\nwritten as an absolute path or relative path.\\n\\n``S3Uri``: represents the location of a S3 object, prefix, or bucket.  This\\nmust be written in the form ``s3://mybucket/mykey`` where ``mybucket`` is\\nthe specified S3 bucket, ``mykey`` is the specified S3 key.  The path argument\\nmust begin with ``s3://`` in order to denote that the path argument refers to\\na S3 object. Note that prefixes are separated by forward slashes. For\\nexample, if the S3 object ``myobject`` had the prefix ``myprefix``, the\\nS3 key would be ``myprefix/myobject``, and if the object was in the bucket\\n``mybucket``, the ``S3Uri`` would be ``s3://mybucket/myprefix/myobject``.\\n\\n``S3Uri`` also supports S3 access points. To specify an access point, this\\nvalue must be of the form ``s3://<access-point-arn>/<key>``. For example if\\nthe access point ``myaccesspoint`` to be used has the ARN:\\n``arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/myaccesspoint`` and the object\\nbeing accessed has the key ``mykey``, then the ``S3URI`` used must be:\\n``s3://arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/myaccesspoint/mykey``.\\nSimilar to bucket names, you can also use prefixes with access point ARNs for\\nthe ``S3Uri``. For example:\\n``s3://arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/myaccesspoint/myprefix/``\\n\\nThe higher level ``s3`` commands do **not** support access point object ARNs.\\nFor example, if the following was specified:\\n``s3://arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/myaccesspoint/object/mykey``\\nthe ``S3URI`` will resolve to the object key ``object/mykey``\\n\\n\\n\\nOrder of Path Arguments\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nEvery command takes one or two positional path arguments.  The first path\\nargument represents the source, which is the local file/directory or S3\\nobject/prefix/bucket that is being referenced.  If there is a second path\\nargument, it represents the destination, which is the local file/directory\\nor S3 object/prefix/bucket that is being operated on.  Commands with only\\none path argument do not have a destination because the operation is being\\nperformed only on the source.\\n\\n\\nSingle Local File and S3 Object Operations\\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nSome commands perform operations only on single files and S3 objects.  The\\nfollowing commands are single file/object operations if no ``--recursive``\\nflag is provided.\\n\\n    * ``cp``\\n    * ``mv``\\n    * ``rm``\\n\\nFor this type of operation, the first path argument, the source, must exist\\nand be a local file or S3 object.  The second path argument, the destination,\\ncan be the name of a local file, local directory, S3 object, S3 prefix,\\nor S3 bucket.\\n\\nThe destination is indicated as a local directory, S3 prefix, or S3 bucket\\nif it ends with a forward slash or back slash.  The use of slash depends\\non the path argument type.  If the path argument is a ``LocalPath``,\\nthe type of slash is the separator used by the operating system.  If the\\npath is a ``S3Uri``, the forward slash must always be used.  If a slash\\nis at the end of the destination, the destination file or object will\\nadopt the name of the source file or object.  Otherwise, if there is no\\nslash at the end, the file or object will be saved under the name provided.\\nSee examples in ``cp`` and ``mv`` to illustrate this description.\\n\\n\\nDirectory and S3 Prefix Operations\\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nSome commands only perform operations on the contents of a local directory\\nor S3 prefix/bucket.  Adding or omitting a forward slash or back slash to\\nthe end of any path argument, depending on its type, does not affect the\\nresults of the operation.  The following commands will always result in\\na directory or S3 prefix/bucket operation:\\n\\n* ``sync``\\n* ``mb``\\n* ``rb``\\n* ``ls``\\n\\n\\nUse of Exclude and Include Filters\\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nCurrently, there is no support for the use of UNIX style wildcards in\\na command\\'s path arguments.  However, most commands have ``--exclude \"<value>\"``\\nand ``--include \"<value>\"`` parameters that can achieve the desired result.\\nThese parameters perform pattern matching to either exclude or include\\na particular file or object.  The following pattern symbols are supported.\\n\\n    * ``*``: Matches everything\\n    * ``?``: Matches any single character\\n    * ``[sequence]``: Matches any character in ``sequence``\\n    * ``[!sequence]``: Matches any character not in ``sequence``\\n\\nAny number of these parameters can be passed to a command.  You can do this by\\nproviding an ``--exclude`` or ``--include`` argument multiple times, e.g.\\n``--include \"*.txt\" --include \"*.png\"``.\\nWhen there are multiple filters, the rule is the filters that appear later in\\nthe command take precedence over filters that appear earlier in the command.\\nFor example, if the filter parameters passed to the command were\\n\\n::\\n\\n    --exclude \"*\" --include \"*.txt\"\\n\\nAll files will be excluded from the command except for files ending with\\n``.txt``  However, if the order of the filter parameters was changed to\\n\\n::\\n\\n    --include \"*.txt\" --exclude \"*\"\\n\\nAll files will be excluded from the command.\\n\\nEach filter is evaluated against the **source directory**.  If the source\\nlocation is a file instead of a directory, the directory containing the file is\\nused as the source directory.  For example, suppose you had the following\\ndirectory structure::\\n\\n    /tmp/foo/\\n      .git/\\n      |---config\\n      |---description\\n      foo.txt\\n      bar.txt\\n      baz.jpg\\n\\nIn the command ``aws s3 sync /tmp/foo s3://bucket/`` the source directory is\\n``/tmp/foo``.  Any include/exclude filters will be evaluated with the source\\ndirectory prepended.  Below are several examples to demonstrate this.\\n\\nGiven the directory structure above and the command\\n``aws s3 cp /tmp/foo s3://bucket/ --recursive --exclude \".git/*\"``, the\\nfiles ``.git/config`` and ``.git/description`` will be excluded from the\\nfiles to upload because the exclude filter ``.git/*`` will have the source\\nprepended to the filter.  This means that::\\n\\n    /tmp/foo/.git/* -> /tmp/foo/.git/config       (matches, should exclude)\\n    /tmp/foo/.git/* -> /tmp/foo/.git/description  (matches, should exclude)\\n    /tmp/foo/.git/* -> /tmp/foo/foo.txt  (does not match, should include)\\n    /tmp/foo/.git/* -> /tmp/foo/bar.txt  (does not match, should include)\\n    /tmp/foo/.git/* -> /tmp/foo/baz.jpg  (does not match, should include)\\n\\nThe command ``aws s3 cp /tmp/foo/ s3://bucket/ --recursive --exclude \"ba*\"``\\nwill exclude ``/tmp/foo/bar.txt`` and ``/tmp/foo/baz.jpg``::\\n\\n    /tmp/foo/ba* -> /tmp/foo/.git/config      (does not match, should include)\\n    /tmp/foo/ba* -> /tmp/foo/.git/description (does not match, should include)\\n    /tmp/foo/ba* -> /tmp/foo/foo.txt          (does not match, should include)\\n    /tmp/foo/ba* -> /tmp/foo/bar.txt  (matches, should exclude)\\n    /tmp/foo/ba* -> /tmp/foo/baz.jpg  (matches, should exclude)\\n\\n\\nNote that, by default, *all files are included*.  This means that\\nproviding **only** an ``--include`` filter will not change what\\nfiles are transferred.  ``--include`` will only re-include files that\\nhave been excluded from an ``--exclude`` filter.  If you only want\\nto upload files with a particular extension, you need to first exclude\\nall files, then re-include the files with the particular extension.\\nThis command will upload **only** files ending with ``.jpg``::\\n\\n    aws s3 cp /tmp/foo/ s3://bucket/ --recursive --exclude \"*\" --include \"*.jpg\"\\n\\nIf you wanted to include both ``.jpg`` files as well as ``.txt`` files you\\ncan run::\\n\\n    aws s3 cp /tmp/foo/ s3://bucket/ --recursive \\\\\\n        --exclude \"*\" --include \"*.jpg\" --include \"*.txt\"\\n',\n      loadSpec: \"aws/s3\"\n    }, {\n      name: \"deploy\",\n      description: \"AWS CodeDeploy AWS CodeDeploy is a deployment service that automates application deployments to Amazon EC2 instances, on-premises instances running in your own facility, serverless AWS Lambda functions, or applications in an Amazon ECS service. You can deploy a nearly unlimited variety of application content, such as an updated Lambda function, updated applications in an Amazon ECS service, code, web and configuration files, executables, packages, scripts, multimedia files, and so on. AWS CodeDeploy can deploy application content stored in Amazon S3 buckets, GitHub repositories, or Bitbucket repositories. You do not need to make changes to your existing code before you can use AWS CodeDeploy. AWS CodeDeploy makes it easier for you to rapidly release new features, helps you avoid downtime during application deployment, and handles the complexity of updating your applications, without many of the risks associated with error-prone manual deployments.  AWS CodeDeploy Components  Use the information in this guide to help you work with the following AWS CodeDeploy components:    Application: A name that uniquely identifies the application you want to deploy. AWS CodeDeploy uses this name, which functions as a container, to ensure the correct combination of revision, deployment configuration, and deployment group are referenced during a deployment.    Deployment group: A set of individual instances, CodeDeploy Lambda deployment configuration settings, or an Amazon ECS service and network details. A Lambda deployment group specifies how to route traffic to a new version of a Lambda function. An Amazon ECS deployment group specifies the service created in Amazon ECS to deploy, a load balancer, and a listener to reroute production traffic to an updated containerized application. An EC2/On-premises deployment group contains individually tagged instances, Amazon EC2 instances in Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups, or both. All deployment groups can specify optional trigger, alarm, and rollback settings.    Deployment configuration: A set of deployment rules and deployment success and failure conditions used by AWS CodeDeploy during a deployment.    Deployment: The process and the components used when updating a Lambda function, a containerized application in an Amazon ECS service, or of installing content on one or more instances.     Application revisions: For an AWS Lambda deployment, this is an AppSpec file that specifies the Lambda function to be updated and one or more functions to validate deployment lifecycle events. For an Amazon ECS deployment, this is an AppSpec file that specifies the Amazon ECS task definition, container, and port where production traffic is rerouted. For an EC2/On-premises deployment, this is an archive file that contains source content\\u2014source code, webpages, executable files, and deployment scripts\\u2014along with an AppSpec file. Revisions are stored in Amazon S3 buckets or GitHub repositories. For Amazon S3, a revision is uniquely identified by its Amazon S3 object key and its ETag, version, or both. For GitHub, a revision is uniquely identified by its commit ID.   This guide also contains information to help you get details about the instances in your deployments, to make on-premises instances available for AWS CodeDeploy deployments, to get details about a Lambda function deployment, and to get details about Amazon ECS service deployments.

Glossary of terms     Server: A configuration management server that can be highly-available. The configuration management server runs on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance, and may use various other AWS services, such as Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) and Elastic Load Balancing. A server is a generic abstraction over the configuration manager that you want to use, much like Amazon RDS. In AWS OpsWorks CM, you do not start or stop servers. After you create servers, they continue to run until they are deleted.    Engine: The engine is the specific configuration manager that you want to use. Valid values in this release include ChefAutomate and Puppet.    Backup: This is an application-level backup of the data that the configuration manager stores. AWS OpsWorks CM creates an S3 bucket for backups when you launch the first server. A backup maintains a snapshot of a server's configuration-related attributes at the time the backup starts.    Events: Events are always related to a server. Events are written during server creation, when health checks run, when backups are created, when system maintenance is performed, etc. When you delete a server, the server's events are also deleted.    Account attributes: Every account has attributes that are assigned in the AWS OpsWorks CM database. These attributes store information about configuration limits (servers, backups, etc.) and your customer account.     Endpoints  AWS OpsWorks CM supports the following endpoints, all HTTPS. You must connect to one of the following endpoints. Your servers can only be accessed or managed within the endpoint in which they are created.   opsworks-cm.us-east-1.amazonaws.com   opsworks-cm.us-east-2.amazonaws.com   opsworks-cm.us-west-1.amazonaws.com   opsworks-cm.us-west-2.amazonaws.com   opsworks-cm.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com   opsworks-cm.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com   opsworks-cm.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com   opsworks-cm.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com   opsworks-cm.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com   For more information, see AWS OpsWorks endpoints and quotas in the AWS General Reference.
